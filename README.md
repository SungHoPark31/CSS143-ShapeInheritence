# CSS143-ShapeInheritence
Uses Inheritance with shapes

Build three classes that inherit from an existing Shape superclass. 
These subclasses should all have the phrase “extends Shape” in their 
class signatures, as in: “public class MyNewShape extends Shape 
{“. Your classes can and should be tested in isolation before combining 
your classes with the final drivers, so consider building a main in 
each subclass that tests out just that class. When you are confident 
in your subclasses, you can use this driver to see your shapes render
to a JPanel.
